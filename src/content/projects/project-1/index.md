**Solar Sense** is an end-to-end energy monitoring solution designed to measure and visualize solar panel performance in real time. Built on an ESP32 microcontroller and supported by a React Native mobile app, the system continuously tracks voltage, current, and power, while storing energy production data for future analysis.

### üîã Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of voltage, current, and power (via INA219 sensor)
- Interactive energy charts with hourly/daily/weekly statistics
- Device configuration via Wi-Fi AP mode or Bluetooth (BLE optional)
- Secure communication with HTTPS
- OTA firmware update support for ESP32
- Offline data buffering and sync once reconnected
- Alerts for low battery or offline state
- Exportable energy data (CSV format)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
**Hardware:** ESP32, INA219, 2S BMS, 18650 batteries, Buck-Boost converter  
**Mobile App:** React Native, react-native-chart-kit, WebSocket, Tailwind (NativeWind), Modal UI  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, WebSocket, Render  
**Connectivity:** AP Mode, optional BLE, MAC-based device identification  
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend), DuckDNS + Tailscale (remote access)

### üß† What I Learned
- End-to-end integration of IoT hardware with cloud and mobile frontends
- Real-time data streaming via WebSocket
- OTA firmware delivery and ESP32 HTTPS support
- Designing energy analytics and power-to-energy conversion in software
- Securing device communication in constrained environments
